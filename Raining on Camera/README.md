This program simply takes in your webcam and makes it rain on-screen with small black circles. If these circles interact with you then they would stop/slow down so that they do not go through you.
It roughly simulates how rain interacts with people. 

The program can identify you by applying a grayscale filter which would separate you from your background. However, the program will still output your normal webcam without the filter so it still looks good.
