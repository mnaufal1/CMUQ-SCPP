This was one of my favorite programs I created since it was very fun to create. This is a digital simulation of a retro Magna Doodle I used to play as a kid.

The program allows the user to draw on a screen and there is a sliding eraser feature to clean the board. It was quite challenging to create the sliding eraser feature but it was a rewarding experience.

I love this program as it shows that the limits of programmings is endless, you really can bring life to anything and this specific program brought back nostalgia of a childhood toy.
