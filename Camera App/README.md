This was a Camera App that I created which takes a picture and applies various filters onto the image. It also saves the capured image in the folder where the program is saved.

I enjoyed creating this program as I faced a lot of challenges, such as: importing a webcam for the program, splitting the image into four different sub-images, resetting the program after a picture is taken.
