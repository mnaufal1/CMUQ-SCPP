# CMUQ-SCPP

I will be uploading all the various projects I have done as part of the Sumnmer College Preview Program held by Carnegie Melon University in Qatar. We learned coding in Processing 3. Since I've already had a small background on Java, learning Processing was a simple process.

Throughout the program, we learned actively by putting into action what we've learned, hence I made multiple projects throughout the program and I will upload some of them here.
